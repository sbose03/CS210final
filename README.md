Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning


This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in online payment systems. Fraud detection is a critical aspect of cybersecurity and financial systems, aiming to protect users and institutions from financial loss and reputational harm.

Project Description

This project explores multiple machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions in an online payment dataset. It addresses challenges such as imbalanced data, precision in fraud detection, and optimizing for real-time deployment. The project employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve robust results.

Plots

The following visualizations are included in the project (in order):

1. Distribution of payment types (Pie Chart)

2. Average transaction amounts for fraudulent transactions by type (Bar Chart)

3. Comparison of average amounts and balances for fraud vs. non-fraud cases (Bar Charts)

4. Time-series visualization of fraud and non-fraud cases over time (Line Plots)

5. Scatter plot showing fraud versus origin account balances

2 MAJOR ISSUES - 

1.  The last three plots were saved separately and are included as image files in the repository due to rendering issues in the notebook.

2. The CSV was to big to be uploaded onto GitHub, as a result I am just providing the Kaggle link to the dataset.

final(1).ipynb: The main notebook containing all code for the project, from preprocessing to model evaluation.

Plots Directory: Contains saved image files for the last three plots that could not render in the notebook.

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sbose03/CS210final/

Install required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Open the notebook final(1).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the full project workflow.

View the saved plots in the Plots directory for additional visual insights.
